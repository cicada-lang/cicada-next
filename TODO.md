# [feature] deepWalk

https://github.com/cicada-lang/cicada/issues/78

**Problem:** `deepWalk` need to do partial evaluation on `Fn`

- **Solution 1:** `deepWalk` takes `type` as argument,
  NOT because of it is doing eta-expansion,
  but because of it need to do partial evaluation of `Fn`,
  thus need `argType` to construct a `TypedNeutral`.

- **Solution 2:** `Values.Fn` and `Cores.Fn` always have `argType`

deepWalk -- Fn

- "solve Fn -- deepWalk"

deepWalk -- FnImplicit

- "solve FnImplicit -- deepWalk"

deepWalk -- ClazzNull ClazzCons ClazzFulfilled

deepWalk -- TypedNeutral
