Welcome **\*^-^\*/**

Cicada language is a _dependently typed programming language_ and an _interactive theorem prover_.

> The aim of cicada project is to help people understand that
> developing software and developing mathematics
> are increasingly the same kind of activity,
> and people who practice these developments
> can learn from each other, and help each other in very good ways.
